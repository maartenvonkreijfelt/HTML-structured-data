    <p>Angela Hashton joined the company in 2009, to initiate new relationships for our growing line of H+ Sports active apparel. After being with the company for a year, she was promoted to Director of Sales. Angela is the drive behind the H+ Sport ACTIVE product line and has an uncanny ability to formulate strategies that have helped build our unified sales force. Educating people about health and nutrition is something that Angela holds dear, and she's excited to play a role in transforming lives.</p>
    <p>She recently founded the KidFit Seattle program, which seeks to encourage kids and their parents to play active games and participate in outdoor activities at least three times a week. KidFit Seattle now has clubs in over 150 area schools, and the program is planning on expanding to other cities next year. We&rsquo;re proud to have Angela on our team!</p>
